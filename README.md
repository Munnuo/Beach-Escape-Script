# Beach-Escape-Script
My first 3D game project. All the code in this repository holds files to the overall game.

============================================================================================

I started this game with an idea of a traditional platformer genre. Beach Escape has a theme of a beach island or getaway
where a young guy has been lost due to being washed away. He wakes up on a distant island to realize there are paths of debris
and dockings of a sea casted ship. 

The goal of the game is to play as young Ethan and to help him find his way to civilization without drowning in the sea by using the debris and other sea casted objects to maneuver between the isles. 

This game will be filled with platform of all sorts varying from standard distance jumps, to moving/rotating platforms, to fragile dockings that break down, to mini canoes that can be used to cross gaps, and much more!

This game will also include interactable sea creatures that attempt to stop Ethan in his tracks, from a giant whale crushing platforms, to a predator shark hunting Ethan down. 

Don't get lost in the sea, help Ethan reach the occupied Islands!
